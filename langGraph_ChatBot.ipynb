In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-07-16\\nTitle: All the attention you need: Global-local, spatial-channel attention for image retrieval\\nAuthors: Chull Hwan Song, Hye Joo Han, Yannis Avrithis\\nSummary: We address representation learning for large-scale instance-level image\\nretrieval. Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular\\napproaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms,\\nwhich are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There\\nare different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of\\nthe feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied\\n(spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two\\nforms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification,\\ndetection or retrieval.\\n  We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end\\nof a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and\\nglobal, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial\\npooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global\\ndescriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of\\nattention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-06-02\\nTitle: RITA: Group Attention is All You Need for Timeseries Analytics\\nAuthors: Jiaming Liang, Lei Cao, Samuel Madden, Zachary Ives, Guoliang Li\\nSummary: Timeseries analytics is of great importance in many real-world applications.\\nRecently, the Transformer model, popular in natural language processing, has\\nbeen leveraged to learn high quality feature embeddings from timeseries, core\\nto the performance of various timeseries analytics tasks. However, the\\nquadratic time and space complexities limit Transformers' scalability,\\nespecially for long timeseries. To address these issues, we develop a\\ntimeseries analytics tool, RITA, which uses a novel attention mechanism, named\\ngroup attention, to address this scalability issue. Group attention dynamically\\nclusters the objects based on their similarity into a small number of groups\\nand approximately computes the attention at the coarse group granularity. It\\nthus significantly reduces the time and space complexity, yet provides a\\ntheoretical guarantee on the quality of the computed attention. The dynamic\\nscheduler of RITA continuously adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nin the training process, ensuring group attention always uses the fewest groups\\nneeded to meet the approximation quality requirement. Extensive experiments on\\nvarious timeseries datasets and analytics tasks demonstrate that RITA\\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and is significantly faster --\\nwith speedups of up to 63X.\""
